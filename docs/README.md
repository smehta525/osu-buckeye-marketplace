## Project Overview
OSU Buckeye Marketplace is a student-only marketplace designed to allow OSU students to buy and sell items securely within the campus community.

## Feature Prioritization
Features were prioritized using a GitHub Kanban board to distinguish MVP launch requirements from future enhancements, based on user needs and journey pain points identified in Milestone 1.

## Architecture Decisions
The system uses a three-tier architecture with a React frontend, .NET Web API backend, and SQL Server database. Architecture decisions are documented using Architecture Decision Records (ADR), including AI-assisted research.
