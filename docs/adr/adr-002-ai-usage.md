# ADR 002: AI Tool Usage

## Status
Accepted

## Context
During the design phase of Milestone 2, AI tools were used to support research and design validation.

## Decision
AI tools were used to explore architectural patterns, validate technology choices, and refine documentation. All final design decisions were made by evaluating project requirements, user needs, and course guidelines.

## Rationale
Using AI-assisted research helped identify industry-standard practices and ensured that architectural decisions aligned with scalability, security, and usability goals.

## Consequences
AI usage improved design efficiency and documentation clarity while maintaining full ownership of final decisions.
